# PL-Fantasy
This repo holds a personal project to pull data from the Premier League Fantasy API as a way to practice Rust. The goal is to use the REST API end-points that make the PL data available (FPL API) and create an interface that is better to use than the app or the webportal.  Documentation for all the end-points can be found [here](https://github.com/skadaman/PL-Fantasy.git).
